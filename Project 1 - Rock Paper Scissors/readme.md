# Rock Paper Scissors

The first project is a beginner-level Rock Paper Scissors project, which is a simple game designed to help beginners learn coding concepts. By creating this project, I'm learing the basics of programming, including variables, functions, conditional statements, and loops. By working on this project, I gained experience in writing clean code, using Git commands to manage version control.

The project involves building a command-line interface game where the user can play against the computer. The user chooses either rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer chooses randomly as well. The program then compares the choices and returns the winner or a tie.

Overall, this project is an excellent stepping stone for anyone interested in learning programming and building their portfolio. So, I recommend give it a try!
