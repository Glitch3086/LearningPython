# Rock Paper Scissors
## Status: âœ…
---
The first project is a Rock Paper Scissors project, which is a simple game designed to help beginners learn coding concepts. By creating this project, I'm learing the basics of programming, including variables, functions, conditional statements, and loops. By working on this project, I gained experience in writing clean code, using Git commands to manage version control.

I followed the Python for Beginners course on freecodecamp.org, which included a video game example that provided subtle hints on what to do next while also giving the answers. For instance, the instructor showed an example of a variable and then asked me to create a variable for the Rock Paper Scissors game, and this pattern continued throughout the entire game section.

The project involves building a command-line interface game where the user can play against the computer. The user chooses either rock, paper, or scissors, and the computer chooses randomly as well. The program then compares the choices and returns the winner or a tie.

Overall, this project is an excellent stepping stone for anyone interested in learning programming and building their portfolio.
