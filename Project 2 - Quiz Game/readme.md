# The Quiz Game
## Status: ðŸš§Currently Working
---

The second project I'm working on is a quiz game in Python, which was a great way to challenge my knowledge of programming concepts while also improving my problem-solving skills. This project is similar to my previous Rock Paper Scissors game because it still uses simmilar python concepts but I build upon those existing concepts.

In this project, I created a command-line interface quiz game that asks the user a series of questions on a particular topic. The program then checks the answers against a set of predefined answers and returns the final score. I used functions to handle the quiz logic and loops to iterate through the questions.

To create the quiz questions, I used various data structures such as lists and dictionaries, which helped me learn about data management in Python. I also used conditional statements to check if the user's answer was correct and to update the score accordingly.

Throughout the project, I focused on writing clean and organized code, using best practices such as modularization and commenting. I also used version control with Git to manage the code changes and keep my code online for others to view and review.

Overall, this project was a fun and challenging way to learn more about programming and improve my skills in Python. It not only helped me review previously written code but also try out new concepts.
