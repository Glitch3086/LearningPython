### A project containing other little projects I made while learning python.

---

As mentioned in the description, this project is a compilation of several small projects that I have completed while learning Python. Each project has its own unique challenges, and by working on them, I aim to enhance my coding skills and gain a deeper understanding of Python as a programming language.

In this repository, you will be able to witness my progress and growth as I continue to learn and create new projects. I will constantly update this repository with new projects as I explore new concepts and techniques in Python. I am excited to share my journey with you and hope that my projects will inspire you to learn and create something new as well.
